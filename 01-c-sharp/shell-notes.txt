shell basics:
    prompt: currently logged-in user, and computer name.
    in yellow: current directory.
    you are always in one directory at a time, given by the yellow indicator.
    ~ is a special name for your home/user directory. (e.g. /c/Users/Revature)
    we can use relative paths and absolute paths
    special meaning of "..": the parent of the current directory.
shell (bash) commands:
    cd: change directory to whatever dir you give as argument.
    ls: list contents of current directory.
    mkdir: create a new folder
    rm: remove files
        with -r: remove folders and files

git commands:
    git clone <.git url>
        creates a new local repository from GitHub.
    git pull
        to pull all new updates from GitHub since the last time you pulled.

dotnet CLI notes:
